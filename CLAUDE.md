# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal GitHub Pages website hosted at `lucasbn.github.io`. The site is a simple static HTML page that serves as a personal blog/portfolio.

## Architecture

- **Static HTML Site**: The entire site consists of a single `index.html` file
- **Content Structure**: The page contains blog-style content about automation and personal experiences
- **No Build System**: This is a pure HTML/CSS site with no build tools, dependencies, or compilation steps
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: The site is automatically deployed via GitHub Pages from the main branch

## Files Structure

- `index.html`: Main and only page of the website
- `README.md`: Simple "Hi" message
- No package.json, dependencies, or build configuration files

## Development Workflow

Since this is a static HTML site:
- Edit `index.html` directly for content changes
- No build, test, or lint commands are needed
- Changes are deployed automatically when pushed to the main branch
- No local development server is required (can open `index.html` directly in browser)

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. No manual deployment steps are required.
