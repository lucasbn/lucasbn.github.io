Default to automation (22/08/2025)

Top line

If something has to be done more than once then you should automate it
and if you're not sure then you should automate it.

What is "something"?

- Running any kind of experiments
- Setting up a development environment (e.g. installing dependencies)
- Applying updates to a system
- Building or releasing anything (CI/CD ?)

Story time

The evaluation of my thesis involved comparing my own Kubernetes CNI to several
other CNIs with benchmarking tools like iperf3, wrk2 and netperf. 

My test bed consisted of two directly connected cloud machines. On each machine
I had to perform the following: (i) install my custom kernel, (ii) install
Kubernetes (master/agent) and any dependencies (iii) configure a particular CNI.
After doing this, I had to (i) deploy a particular set of pods, (ii) exec into
those pods and run a particular script on each (iii) copy the results over to my
host machine.

This was a super tedious process that would end up taking at least an hour for
each CNI I was evaluating, not including any time spent painfully debugging some
issue caused by my inevitable messing up of something somewhere.

I was naive enough to believe that I would only have to go through this process
once. Of course, I actually ended up doing this around 10-20 times.

Because I needed to manually run some commands every 30-60 minutes to kick off
the next experiment or setup another CNI, I ended up just sitting around
watching Netflix or reading my book whilst waiting for each experiment to
finish. At the time I told myself "I'm exhausted and this way I can relax a bit
whilst still getting the results". But it wasn't relaxing at all: my brain was
constantly switched on, and I was constantly checking on the experiment to make
sure the results were inline with my expectations.

Looking back, this was the worst thing I could've done: I wasn't really doing
anything "productive" in that time and I also wasn't relaxing. I probably lost
between 50 and 100 hours doing this.

Ideally, I would've automated this process to require a single push of a button
and then for all the results to be saved on my host machine automatically. This
way, I could've gone and done something actually relaxing for a few hours (like
playing golf or tennis). Or, I could've let the experiment run in the background
whilst I work on another part of the project (or a completely different
project). 

The other big benefit is that when you want to change your experiment, you can
do so very quickly and without much hassle. Near the deadline, we realised it
would be nice to widen the scope of one of the benchmarks but couldn't because
it would take too long to set everything up. If this was automated, we probably
would have been able to.

I think the "idea" here is super obvious, but I think the challenge is being
able to have the foresight to realise when to automate something and stop
yourself from taking the path that is slightly easier in the short-term but much
more tedious in the long term.

Going forward, I'm going to try to "default towards automation" rather than
"default towards manual work" and see where that gets me. Plus, with ChatGPT and
vibe-coding automating things has never been easier.
